# Godot test

A simple 2D platformer so I may try Godot.

Game world settings will be based on a friend's comic:
[Tinta fresca](https://digofreitas.com/loja/produto/tinta-fresca-destino-tracado/)
(part of it has been/is being
[published online](https://digofreitas.com/capitulo/tinta-fresca-destino-tracado/)).
I may eventually rename the repository to fully embrace that...

For now, though, it's only a small test thing...
